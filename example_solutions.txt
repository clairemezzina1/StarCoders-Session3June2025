Challenges

0) Introduce the application. Try out the UI, and walk through app.component.html.
Understand how the components are connected.

1) Run the app and find an action movies with a critic score above 70 
and have a maximum rating of PG-13.
        - Black Panther
        - Inception
        - Godzilla Minus One

2) Display the movie's plot in the search results.
        - Look at movie-result.component.html (and the OmdbResultDetails function in 
        omdb.ts for help on variable names). Line 7 add "<p>{{this.result()?.plot}}</p>"

3) Another easy-ish challenge?

4) Explore each component independently! Spend 5 minutes working independently, 
and then discuss with the group. 
    a) Change the first criteria to "Choose a Maximum Critic Score"
        - Look at critic-score.component.ts, checkScores function. 
        Line 63 should be "<=".

    b) Change the second criteria to have an option for "Documentary"
        - Look at genre.component.html. Add an additional input 
        and label similar to how other genres are implemented.

    c) Change the first criteria to "Choose a Minimum Rating"
        - Look at omdb.ts, compareMpaaRatings function. Line 26 switch "a" and "b"

5) Modify the application to that movie results are generated when any field is changed,
not using the button.
